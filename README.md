# springboot-c3p0-mybatis-jasypt
Demo for integration between springboot &amp; c3p0 &amp; mybatis &amp; jasypt

In this repo I am using Spring, c3p0 as a pool connection lib, mybatis as a Lightweight ORM and jasypt for password encription.
Also I have configured logback and I have included a custom appender just for fun.

I also have to say that this is a fork from: com.techprimers.mybatis.springbootmybatis github example

Thanks, men !
